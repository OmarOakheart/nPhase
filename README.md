# nPhase
Ploidy agnostic phasing pipeline and algorithm

![Alt text](/img/nPhasePipeline.jpg?raw=true "nPhase Pipeline")

nPhase is a ploidy agnostic tool developed in python which predicts the haplotypes of a sample that was sequenced by both long and short reads by aligning them to a reference. It should work with any ploidy.

# Quick-start

[![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/oakheart/nphase/badges/installer/conda.svg)](https://conda.anaconda.org/oakheart)

If you have bioconda you can install nPhase by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
conda create -n polyploidPhasing python=3.8
conda activate polyploidPhasing
conda install -c oakheart nphase
```

Then you can phase your data with the following command:

```
nphase pipeline --sampleName Individual_1 --reference /path/to/Individual_referenceGenome.fasta 
                --R1 /path/to/Individual_1_shortReads_R1.fastq.gz --R2 /path/to/Individual_1_shortReads_R2.fastq.gz
                --longReads /path/to/Individual_1_longReads.fastq.gz --longReadPlatform [ont|pacbio]
                --output /path/to/outputFolder
```

Once you've phased your data, you can use our automated cleaning method on the raw results with the following command:



```
nphase cleaning --sampleName Cleaning_1 --resultFolder /path/to/outputFolder/Individual_1
                --longReads /path/to/Individual_1_longReads.fastq.gz
```

# Installation

## With bioconda

Install bioconda and set the correct channels by following the first two steps here: https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html

Then you can create a new environment and install nPhase with the following commands:
```
conda create -n polyploidPhasing python=3.8
conda activate polyploidPhasing
conda install -c oakheart nphase
```

## Without bioconda

### Pre-requisites

You will have to install the following software before nPhase:

[Python â‰¥3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

[bwa mem](https://github.com/lh3/bwa)

[GATK 4.0](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk)

[samtools v1.9](https://github.com/samtools/samtools/tree/1.9)*

[ngmlr](https://github.com/philres/ngmlr)

\*Currently, installing samtools v1.10 or higher will cause an error to occur due to [a bug in the way ngmlr handles MAPQ scores](https://github.com/philres/ngmlr/issues/83).

### Installation via PyPI

You can now install nPhase via

`pip install -U nPhase`

# Usage

There are two main ways to run nPhase:

`nphase pipeline` will run the entire pipeline from start to finish and requires the following inputs:

```
nphase pipeline --sampleName SAMPLE_NAME --reference REFERENCE --output OUTPUT_FOLDER --longReads LONG_READ_FILE
                --longReadPlatform {ont,pacbio} --R1 SHORT_READ_FILE_R1 --R2 SHORT_READ_FILE_R2
```
Optional parameters are described further down.

`nphase algorithm` will only run the phasing algorithm, it requires inputs generated by `nphase pipeline`. This is useful if you want to test different paramaters on your dataset after having generated the pre-processed files once. Here are the inputs required by `nphase algorithm`:

```
nphase algorithm --sampleName SAMPLE_NAME --reference REFERENCE --output OUTPUT_FOLDER --longReads LONG_READ_FILE
                 --contextDepth CONTEXT_DEPTHS_FILE --processedLongReads VALIDATED_SNP_ASSIGNMENTS_FILE
```

Optional parameters are described further down.

# nphase partial

Alternatively, if you already mapped your short reads to a reference, or your long reads, or already variant called your mapped short reads, you can try to use

`nphase partial` which will run only the parts of the pipeline that you need to run. So for example if you provide it with a vcf file, then it will only try to map the long reads. If you provide it with mapped short reads and mapped long reads, it will only variant call the short reads, etc. This is not recommended since I can't control what you input but it can save people time or allow for more creative uses of nPhase.

Here are the use cases of `nphase partial`:

You have mapped long reads and a vcf file of your short reads:
```
nphase partial --sampleName SAMPLE_NAME --reference REFERENCE --output OUTPUT_FOLDER --longReads LONG_READ_FILE
               --vcf VCF_FILE --mappedLongReads MAPPED_LONG_READ_FILE
```
You have mapped long reads and mapped short reads, but not vcf:
```
nphase partial --sampleName SAMPLE_NAME --reference REFERENCE --output OUTPUT_FOLDER --longReads LONG_READ_FILE
               --mappedLongReads MAPPED_LONG_READ_FILE --mappedShortReads MAPPED_SHORT_READ_FILE
```
You have mapped long reads, but no mapped short reads and no vcf:
```
nphase partial --sampleName SAMPLE_NAME --reference REFERENCE --output OUTPUT_FOLDER --longReads LONG_READ_FILE
               --mappedLongReads MAPPED_LONG_READ_FILE --R1 SHORT_READ_FILE_R1 --R2 SHORT_READ_FILE_R2
```
You have a short read vcf, but no mapped long reads:
```
nphase partial --sampleName SAMPLE_NAME --reference REFERENCE --output OUTPUT_FOLDER --longReads LONG_READ_FILE
               --vcf VCF_FILE --longReadPlatform {ont,pacbio}
```
You have mapped short reads, but no mapped long reads and no vcf:
```
nphase partial --sampleName SAMPLE_NAME --reference REFERENCE --output OUTPUT_FOLDER --longReads LONG_READ_FILE
               --mappedShortReads MAPPED_SHORT_READ_FILE --longReadPlatform {ont,pacbio}
```

[nPhase: An accurate and contiguous phasing method for polyploids](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.219105v1)


### Presentations

Online lightning talk I gave about nPhase for an Oxford Nanopore event [5:44]: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16quLufiNhICXqmAAGRYEIy1MivWVMXVI/view?usp=sharing)

### Misc

Current recommendations for default parameters are at least 20X coverage per haplotype (so 3\*20=60X for a triploid) and a heterozygosity level of at least 0.4% (average of 1 heterozygous SNP every 250 bp).

It is currently untested on pacbio data so if you have a pacbio dataset (with a known ground truth) please contact me (raise an issue on github or email me), especially if you have errors.

There is an example dataset on this github, in the example folder, which you can test nPhase on. It contains a reference sequence, short reads and long reads. The result should look like a triploid and it should run quickly.
